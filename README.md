# Looping Through an Array in JavaScript

This repository contains JavaScript code that demonstrates how to loop through an array using a `for` loop.

## Code Explanation

The JavaScript code iterates through the elements of the `language` array using a `for` loop. 
Each element of the array is concatenated to the `fullarray` string variable with double spaces. Finally, the `fullarray` is logged to the console.
